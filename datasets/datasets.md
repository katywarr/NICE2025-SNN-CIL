# Placeholder directory for data

This is the folder where datasets are cached. This is useful to ensure consistent test/training samples are 
used across simulations. It is also faster to prepare the data just once.

To prepare data and save data, use the `src/simulation_data.py` script or the Jupyter 
notebook `examples/1 - Generate Data.ipynb`.
